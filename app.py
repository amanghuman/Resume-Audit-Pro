## 🚨 Major Issues (Red Flags)

| Issue                       | Original Example                                      | Improved Example                                      |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Vague Bullet Point         | "Worked on team projects"                             | "Collaborated with 4-person team to develop a web app used by 200+ students" |
| Weak Action Verb           | "Responsible for social media"                        | "Managed and grew Instagram following by 30% in 3 months" |
| No Quantifiable Impact     | "Helped with data entry"                              | "Entered and verified 1,200+ records with 99.8% accuracy over 2 months" |

## 🔧 Fix Recommendations

Below are quick and deep fixes across three key areas of resume improvement: **Content**, **Design**, and **Strategy**.

### 📌 Content

**Quick Fix (≤1 hr):**  
- Rewrite bullet points using strong action verbs (e.g., "Led", "Created", "Improved").
- Avoid passive or vague phrases like "Worked on" or "Helped with."
  
**Use this format:**

❌ *[Original bullet from resume]*  

✅ *[Improved version using action verb, clarity, and result]*

**Deep Fix (3–5 hrs):**  
- Reframe each experience to show outcomes and impact. Use the **[Action] + [What you did] + [Result]** format.  
- Add quantifiable metrics (e.g., "increased sales by 15%," "managed budget of $10K").  
- Tailor descriptions to reflect competencies relevant to the target role or industry.

---

### 🎨 Design

**Quick Fix (≤1 hr):**  
- Use consistent fonts, spacing, and alignment.  
- Make sure section headers are clear and bold, and that margins are not cramped.

**Example (based on resume):**  

❌ *Multiple font sizes used in 'Experience' section*

✅ *Use one consistent font (e.g., Calibri 11pt) and align all bullets to left*

**Deep Fix (3–5 hrs):**  
- Apply a modern, ATS-friendly layout (e.g., left-aligned layout, no columns or graphics).  
- Use section hierarchy (Summary → Skills → Experience → Education → Projects).  
- Remove clutter like icons, photos, or complex visual elements that confuse ATS parsing.

---

### 🎯 Strategy

**Quick Fix (≤1 hr):**  
- Add 4–6 keywords from a relevant job description (skills, tools, roles).
- Rewrite your summary to clearly state your goal and top strengths.

**Use this format:**

❌ *[Original summary from resume]*  

✅ *[Improved version with clearer career goals and targeted language]*

**Deep Fix (3–5 hrs):**  
- Research 2–3 target job listings and align resume language and structure to match.  
- Prioritize the most relevant experiences—even if not in reverse chronological order.  
- Refine the resume narrative to reflect your career goals and unique value proposition.
